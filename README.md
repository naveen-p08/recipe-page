<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](recipe%20page.png)
You can see the Demo [Here](https://root9259.github.io/recipe-page/)

The numbered list and the checkbox alignment styles are made using the negative margin method. Examples to the method can be found [here](https://jsfiddle.net/b3dayLzo/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14347290/left-align-both-list-numbers-and-text)

The numbered list counter is created and styled with the css Counter() function. Example can be found [here](https://codepen.io/sawmac/pen/qBKzmM)
